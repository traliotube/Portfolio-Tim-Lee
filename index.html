        Tim Berners-Lee, in full Sir Tim Berners-Lee, (born June 8, 1955,
        London, England), British computer scientist, generally credited as the
        inventor of the World Wide Web. In 2004 he was awarded a knighthood by
        Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom and the inaugural Millennium
        Technology Prize (€1 million) by the Finnish Technology Award
        Foundation. Computing came naturally to Berners-Lee, as both of his
        parents worked on the Ferranti Mark I, the first commercial computer.
        (See computer: The first stored-program machines.) After graduating in
        1976 from the University of Oxford, Berners-Lee designed computer
        software for two years at Plessey Telecommunications Ltd., located in
        Poole, Dorset, England. Following this, he had several positions in the
        computer industry, including a stint from June to December 1980 as a
        software engineering consultant at CERN, the European particle physics
        laboratory in Geneva. While at CERN, Berners-Lee developed a program for
        himself, called Enquire, that could store information in files that
        contained connections (“links”) both within and among separate files—a
        technique that became known as hypertext. After leaving CERN,
        Berners-Lee worked for Image Computer Systems Ltd., located in Ferndown,
        Dorset, where he designed a variety of computer systems. In 1984 he
        returned to CERN to work on the design of the laboratory’s computer
        network, developing procedures that allowed diverse computers to
        communicate with one another and researchers to control remote machines.
        In 1989 Berners-Lee drew up a proposal for creating a global hypertext
        document system that would make use of the Internet. His goal was to
        provide researchers with the ability to share their results, techniques,
        and practices without having to exchange e-mail constantly. Instead,
        researchers would place such information “online,” where their peers
        could immediately retrieve it anytime, day or night. Berners-Lee wrote
        the software for the first Web server (the central repository for the
        files to be shared) and the first Web client, or “browser” (the program
        to access and display files retrieved from the server), between October
        1990 and the summer of 1991. The first “killer application” of the Web
        at CERN was the laboratory’s telephone directory—a mundane beginning for
        one of the technological wonders of the computer age. From 1991 to 1993
        Berners-Lee evangelized the Web. In 1994 in the United States he
        established the World Wide Web (W3) Consortium at the Massachusetts
        Institute of Technology’s Laboratory for Computer Science. The
        consortium, in consultation with others, lends oversight to the Web and
        the development of standards. In 1999 Berners-Lee became the first
        holder of the 3Com Founders chair at the Laboratory for Computer
        Science. His numerous other honours included the National Academy of
        Engineering’s prestigious Charles Stark Draper Prize (2007). Berners-Lee
        was the author, along with Mark Fischetti, of Weaving the Web: The
        Original Design and Ultimate Destiny of the World Wide Web (2000).
